    """Report results of testcase execution into a MongoDB database

    The database used is pointed to by MongoDB URL :attr:`url` and
    name :attr:`db_name`.

    **Testcase execution results**

    The results of execution (pass/errr/fail/skip/block) are stored in
    a collection called *results*.

    For each testcase and the targets where it is ran on
    (identified by a *hashid*) we generate a *document*; each
    report done for that this *hashid* is a *record* in said
    document with any attachments stored.

    Each result document is keyed by *runid:hashid* and structured
    as:

    - result:
    - runid:
    - hashid
    - tc_name
    - target_name
    - target_types
    - target_server
    - timestamp
    - targest: dict of keyed by target name

      - TARGETNAME:

        - id
        - server
        - type
        - bsp_model

    - results: list of

      - timestamp
      - ident
      - level
      - tag
      - message
      - attachments

    Notes:

    - When a field is missing we don't insert it to save space, it
      has to be considered an empty string (if we expected one) or
      none present

    Usage:

    1. Ensure you have a access to a MongoDB in ``HOST:PORT``,
       where you can create (or there is already) a database called
       ``DATABASENAME``.

    2. Create a TCF configuration file
       ``{/etc/tcf,~,.}/.tcf/conf_mongodb.py`` with:

       .. code-block:: python

          import tcfl.report
          import tcfl.report_mongodb
          m = tcfl.report_mongodb.report_mongodb_c()
          m.url = "mongodb://HOST:PORT" # Or a more complex mongodb URL
          m.db_name = "DATABASENAME"
          m.collection_name = "COLLECTIONNAME"
          # Optional: modify the record before going in
          m.complete_hooks.append(SOMEHOOKFUNCTION)
          tcfl.report.report_c.driver_add(m)

    **Troubleshooting**

    - When giving SSL and passwords in the URL, the connection fails
      with messages such as *ConfigurationError: command SON(...)
      failed: auth failed*

      The installation of PyMongo in your system might be too old, we
      need > v3.
