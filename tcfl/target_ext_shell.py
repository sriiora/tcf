Run commands a shell available on a target's serial console
-----------------------------------------------------------

Also allows basic file transmission over serial line.

Shell prompts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Waiting for a shell prompt is quite a harder problem that it seems to
be at the beginning.

Problems:

- Background processes or (in the serial console, the kernel) printing
  lines in the middle.

  Even with line buffered output, when there are different CRLF
  conventions, a misplaced newline or carriage return can break havoc.

  As well, if a background process / kernel prints a message after the
  prompt is printed, a ``$`` will no longer match. The ``\Z`` regex
  operator cannot be used for the same reason.

- CRLF conventions make it harder to use the ``^`` and ``$`` regex
  expression metacharacteds.

- ANSI sequences, human doesn't see/notice them, but to the computer /
  regular expression they are 

Thus, resorting to match a single line is the best bet; however, it is
almost impossible to guarantee that it is the last one as the multiple
formats of prompts could be matching other text.
