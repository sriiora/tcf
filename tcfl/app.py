"""Application builder are a generic tool for building applications of
different types.

They all use the same interface to make it easy and fast for the test
case writer to specify what has to be built for which BSP of which
target with a very simple specification given to the
:func:`tcfl.tc.target` decorator:

>>> tcfl.tc.target(app_zephyr = { 'x86': "path/to/zephyr_app" },
>>>                app_sketch = { 'arc': "path/to/sketch" })
>>> class mytestcase(tcfl.tc.tc_c):
>>> ...

which allows the testcase developer to point the app builders to the
locations of the source code and on which BSPs of the targets it shall
run and have it deal with the details of inserting the right code to
build, deploy, setup and start the testcase.

This allows the testcase writer to focus on writing the test
application.


App builders:

- can be made once and reused multiple times
- they are plugins to the testcase system
- keep no state; they need to be able to gather everything
  from the parameters passed (this is needed so they can be called from
  multiple threads).
- are always called *app_SOMETHING*

Note implementation details on :py:class:`tcfl.app.app_c`; drivers can
be added with :py:func:`tcfl.app.driver_add`.

Currently available application buildrs for:

 - :class:`Zephyr OS apps <tcfl.app_zephyr.app_zephyr>`
 - :class:`Arduino Sketches <tcfl.app_sketch.app_sketch>`

    only of what is needed.

    The driver will be invoked by the test runner using the methods
    :py:func:`tcfl.app.configure`, :py:func:`tcfl.app.build`,
    :py:func:`tcfl.app.deploy`, :py:func:`tcfl.app.setup`,
    :py:func:`tcfl.app.start`, :py:func:`tcfl.app.teardown`,
    :py:func:`tcfl.app.clean`.

    If your App builder does not need to implement any, then it is
    enough with not specifying it in the class.

    **Targets with multiple BSPs**

    When the target contains multiple BSPs the App builders are
    invoked for each BSP in the same order as they were declared with
    the decorator :py:func:`tcfl.tc.target`. E.g.:

    >>> @tcfl.tc.target(app_zephyr = { 'arc': 'path/to/zephyr_code' },
    >>>                 app_sketch = { 'x86': 'path/to/arduino_code' })

    We are specifying that the *x86* BSP in the target has to run code
    to be built with the Arduino IDE/compiler and the *arc* core will
    run a Zephyr app, built with the Zephyr SDK.

    If the target is being ran in a BSP model where one or more of the
    BSPs are not used, the App builders are responsible for providing
    stub information with :meth:`tcfl.tc.target_c.stub_app_add`. As
    well, if an app builder determines a BSP does not need to be
    stubbed, it can also remove it from the target's list with:

    >>> del target.bsps_stub[BSPNAME]

    Note this removal is done at the specific target level, as each
    target might have different models or needs.


    Note you can use the dictionary :py:meth:`tcfl.tc.tc_c.buffers` to
    store data to communicate amongst phases. This dictionary:

    - will be cleaned in between evaluation runs

    - is not multi-threaded protected; take
      :py:meth:`tcfl.tc.tc_c.buffers_lock` if you need to access it
      from different paralell execution methods
      (setup/start/eval/test/teardown methods are *always* executed
      serially).

    - take care not to *start* more than once; app builders are setup
      to start a target only if there is not a field
      *started-TARGETNAME* set to *True*.
