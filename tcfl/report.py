    and the output it saved to those separate files.

    The default configuraton (the *text* template) will generate files

    #: Jinja2 will replace that in the final report in the placeholder
    #: for ``{%= block HEADER_PREFIX -%}``.
    #:
    #: Fields available (to be used as Jinja2 variables with ``{{ FIELD
    #: }}`` and other Jinja2 operators:
    #:
    #: - Any :ref:`testcase keywords <finding_testcase_metadata>`
    #:
    #: - *{{ msg_tag }}*: testcase's result (``PASS``,
    #:   ``FAIL``, ``ERRR``, ``SKIP``, ``BLCK``), also as ``{{ result }}``
    #:   and ``{{ result_past }}`` formatted for text in present and past
    #:   tense (eg: *pass* vs *passed*)
    #:
    #: - *{{ message }}*: message that came with the top level report
    #:   (``COMPLETION passed|failed|error|failed|skip|block``)
    #:
    #: - any variable defined in the the ``tcfl.config`` space is
    #:   mapped to ``tcfl_config_``; for example *{{
    #:   tcfl_config_urls }}* which maps to :data:`tcfl.config.urls`
    #:
    #:   Only variables of the following types are exported: integers,
    #:   strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples.
    #:
    #: - *{{ t_option }}* a value that indicates what has to be given to
    #:   *tcf* to select the targets where the testcase was run.
    #:
    #: - *{{ log }}*: an iterator to the contents of log files that
    #:   returns three fields:
    #:   - message identifier
    #:   - target group name
    #:   - message itself
    #:
    #:   Can be used as::
    #:
    #:     {% for ident, tgname, message in log -%}
    #:     {{ "%-10s %-25s %s" | format(ident, tgname, message) }}
    #:     {% endfor %}
    #:
    #:   Depending on the destination format, you can pipe this
    #:   through Jinja2 `filters
    #:   <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#filters>`_ to
    #:   escape certain characters. For example, there is:
    #:
    #:   - :func:`escape <jinja2.escape>` which escapes suitable for HTML
    #:
    #:   - :func:`xml_escape <jinja2_xml_escape>` which escapes
    #:     suitable for XML
    #:
    #:   which can be used as::
    #:
    #:     {% for ident, tgname, message in log -%}
    #:     {{ "%-10s %-25s %s" | format(ident, tgname, message) | xml_escape }}
    #:     {% endfor %}
    #:
    #: - *{{ targets }}*: list of targets used for the testcases, with
    #:   fields:
    #:
    #:   - ``want_name`` (str): name the testcase gave to this target
    #:     (e.g.: *target*)
    #:
    #:   - ``fullid`` (str): name of the actual target at the server
    #:     (e.g.: *SERVERNAME/qz43i-x86*)
    #:
    #:   - ``type`` (str): type of the target (e.g.: *qemu-linux-XYZ*)
    #:
    #: *Extending and modifying keywords*
    #:
    #: :data:`Hook <hooks>` functions can be configured to execute
    #: before the testcase is launched, they can be used to extend the
    #: keywords available to the templates or any other things.
