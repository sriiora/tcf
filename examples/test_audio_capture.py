"""Reproducing audio and capturing the output
==========================================

Given a target from which we can record audio, play a beep sound,
record it, and then compare with the original

The target selection for this test is any target that can be
provisioned with :ref:`Provisioning OS <pos_setup>` and supports
capture of audio over capturer called *front_astream*, which is
usually connected to the front audio output of the target.

The :download:`sound file <../examples/data/beep.wav>` is a beep,
located in the *examples/data* subdirectory and is sent to the
target during the deployment phase, after flashing the image.

When the OS boots, the *beep.wav* file is already in */home*,
ready to be played. The test starts recording the target's audio
output, plays the *beep*, and then downloads the recording.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/test_audio_capture.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: _test

Execute :download:`the testcase <../examples/test_audio_capture.py>`
with (where *IMAGE* is the name of a Linux OS image :ref:`installed in
the server <pos_list_images>`)::

  $ IMAGE=clear tcf run -vv /usr/share/tcf/examples/test_audio_capture.py

(depending on your installation method, location might be
*~/.local/share/tcf/examples*)

where IMAGE is the name of a Linux OS image :ref:`installed in the
server <pos_list_images>`.
