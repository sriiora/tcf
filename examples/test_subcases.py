Reporting subcases
==================

A common execution pattern is that a testcase executes and produces
results for multiple subcases.

In this example, given a target that can be provisioned with
:ref:`Provisioning OS <pos_setup>`, we create a fake testcase that
generates ten subtestcase reports in individual logfiles called
*subN.log*.

When the testcase is created, in the *__init__()* method, we would
scan the test to discover the list of subcases that will unfold--in
this example, we are faking it--this is important because it allows us
to double check that all we expected to execute will.

In general, the name of the subcase is the name of the testcase plus a
*dot something* (in this case we append *.subN*); then it is added to
the :data:`subtestcase dictionary self.subtc <tcfl.tc.tc_c.subtc>` by
creating an instancel of :class:`tcfl.tc.subtc_c`, which implements
this pattern.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/test_subcases.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: _test

Execute :download:`the testcase <../examples/test_subcases.py>`
with (where *IMAGE* is the name of a Linux OS image :ref:`installed in
the server <pos_list_images>`)::

  $ IMAGE=clear tcf run -v /usr/share/tcf/examples/test_subcases.py

(depending on your installation method, location might be
*~/.local/share/tcf/examples*)

where IMAGE is the name of a Linux OS image :ref:`installed in the
server <pos_list_images>`.
