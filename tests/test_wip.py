    #        - ic testcase to verify in limited mode multiple types of
    #          the same IC are ignored for candidate picks

    #          (now it is ksipped with no message)

    #        - for tcob, we want to run on all mv, ma, a101 but we don't
    #          care about combos on A2, so to generate TGs, we want to
    #          tell it to go single-target-style on the DUT, but not on
    #          the TCOB
    #
    #          In a way it'd be telling that for targets with some mark
    #          we want to cover as much variety as possible and that
    #          would override the limits. By default, if only one
    #          target, the target has a that setting.
