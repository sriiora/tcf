      downstream ports:

      - *None*: leave them as they are

      - *False*: power them off

      - *True*: power them on

    **Overview**

    **Bill of materials**

    - a DLWPS7 unit and power cable connected to power plug

    - a network cable

    - a connection to a network switch to which the server is also
      connected (*nsN*)

    **Connecting the power switch**

    1. Ensure you have configured an class C *192.168.X.0/24*,
       configured with static IP addresses, to which maybe only this
       server has access to connect IP-controlled power
       switches.

       Follow :ref:`these instructions <internal_network>` to create a
       network.

       You might need a new Ethernet adaptor to connect to said
       network (might be PCI, USB, etc).

    2. connect the power switch to said network

    3. assign a name to the power switch and add it along its IP
       address in ``/etc/hosts``; convention is to call them *spY*,
       where X is a number and *sp* stands for *Switch; Power*.

       .. warning:: if your system uses proxies, you need to add *spY*
          also to the *no_proxy* environment varible in
          :file:`/etc/bashrc` to avoid the daemon trying to access the
          power switch through the proxy, which will not work.

    4. with the names ``/etc/hosts``, refer to the switches by name
       rather than by IP address.

    **Configuring the system**

    1. Choose a name for the power switch (*spM*), where *M* is a number

    2. The power switch starts with IP address *192.168.0.100*; it needs
       to be changed to *192.168.X.M*:

       a. Connect to *nsN*

       b. Ensure the server access to *192.168.0.100* by adding this
          routing hack::

            # ifconfig nsN:2 192.168.0.0/24

       c. With lynx or a web browser, from the server, access the
          switch's web control interface::

          $ lynx http://192.168.0.100

       d. Enter the default user *admin*, password *1234*, select *ok*
          and indicate *A* to always accept cookies

          .. warning: keep the default user and password at
                      *admin*/*1234*, the default configuration relies
                      on it. It makes no sense to change it anyway as
                      you will have to write them down in the
                      configuration. Limitations of HTTP Basic Auth

       e. Hit enter to refresh link redirecting to
          *192.168.0.100/index.htm*, scroll down to *Setup*,
          select. On all this steps, make sure to hit submit for each
          individual change.

          1. Lookup setup of IP address, change to *192.168.N.M* (where *x*
             matches *spM*), gateway *192.168.N.1*; hit the *submit* next to
             it.

          2. Disable the security lockout in section *Delay*

             Set *Wrong password lockout* set to zero minutes

          3. Turn on setting power after power loss:

             *Power Loss Recovery Mode > When recovering after power
             loss* select *Turn all outlets on*

          4. Extra steps needed for newer units
             (https://dlidirect.com/products/new-pro-switch)

             The new refreshed unit looks the same, but has wifi
             connectivity and pleny of new features, some of which
             need tweaking; login to the setup page again and for each
             of this, set the value/s and hit *submit* before going to
             the next one:

             - Access setings (quite important, as this allows the
               driver to access the same way for the previous
               generation of the product too):

               ENABLE: *allow legacy plaintext login methods*

               Note in (3) below it is explained why this is not a
               security problem in this kind of deployments.

       g. remove the routing hack::

            # ifconfig nsN:2 down

    3. The unit's default admin username and password are kept per
       original (admin, 1234):

       - They are deployed in a dedicated network switch that is internal
         to the server; none has access but the server users (targets run
         on another switch).

       - they use HTTP Basic Auth, they might as well not use
         authentication

    4. Add an entry in ``/etc/hosts`` for *spM* so we can refer to the
       DLWPS7 by name instead of IP address::

         192.168.4.X	spM

    1. Connect the USB A-Male to the free server USB port
