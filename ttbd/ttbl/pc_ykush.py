        A power control implementation using an YKUSH switchable hub
        https://www.yepkit.com/products/ykush

        This is mainly devices that are USB powered and the ykush hub
        is used to control the power to the ports.

        Note this devices appears as a child connected to the YKUSH
        hub, with vendor/device IDs 0x04d8:f2f7 (Microchip Technology)

        You can find the right one with `lsusb.py -ciu`::

        Note the *Yepkit Ltd, YK20345*; *YK20345* is the serial number.

        To avoid permission issues:

        - choose a Unix group that the daemon will be running under

        - add a UDEV rule to ``/etc/udev/rules.d/90-tcf.rules`` (or
          other name)::

            # YKUSH power switch hubs
            SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTR{idProduct}=="f2f7", \
              GROUP="GROUPNAME", MODE = "660"

        - restart UDEV, replug your hubs::

            $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

        :param str ykush_serial: Serial number of the ykush's control
          device.

        :param int port: Port number in the hub (one-based)

        .. warning: it is *strongly* recommended to also create targets with
                    with :func:`ykush_targets_add` to manage the hub
                    itself and that it is power controlled so it can
                    be automatically recovered when it fails (that it
                    happens). Look at :meth:`_try_resolving`.
