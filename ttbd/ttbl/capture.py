Stream and snapshot capture interace
------------------------------------

This module implements an interface to capture things in the server
and then return them to the client.

This can be used to, for example:

-  capture screenshots of a screen, by connecting the target's output
   to a framegrabber, for example:

   - `MYPIN HDMI Game Capture Card USB 3.0
     <https://www.amazon.com/AGPTEK-Capture-Streaming-Recorder-Compatible/dp/B074863G59/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=MYPIN+HDMI+Game+Capture&qid=1556209779&s=electronics&sr=1-2-spons&psc=1>`_

   - `LKV373A <https://www.lenkeng.net/Index/detail/id/149>`_

   ...

   and then running somethig such as ffmpeg on its output

- capture a video stream (with audio) when the controller can say when
  to start and when to end

- capture network traffic with tcpdump

class generic_snapshot(impl_c):
    """This is a generic snaptshot capturer which can be used to invoke any
    program that will do capture a snapshot.

    For example, in a server configuration file, define a capturer
    that will connect to VNC and take a screenshot:

    >>> capture_screenshot_vnc = ttbl.capture.generic_snapshot(
    >>>     "%(id)s VNC @localhost:%(vnc_port)s",
    >>>     # need to make sure vnc_port is defined in the target's tags
    >>>     "gvnccapture -q localhost:%(vnc_port)s %(output_file_name)s",
    >>>     mimetype = "image/png"
    >>> )

    Then attach the capture interface to the target with:

    >>> ttbl.config.targets['TARGETNAME'].interface_add(
    >>>     "capture",
    >>>     ttbl.capture.interface(
    >>>         vnc0 = capture_screenshot_vnc,
    >>>         ...
    >>>     )
    >>> )

    Now the command::

      $ tcf capture-get TARGETNAME vnc0 file.png

    will download to ``file.png`` a capture of the target's screen via
    VNC.

    :param str name: name for error messages from this capturer.

      E.g.: `%(id)s HDMI`

    :param str cmdline: commandline to invoke the capturing the
      snapshot.

      E.g.: `ffmpeg -i /dev/video-%(id)s`; in this case udev
      has been configured to create a symlink called
      */dev/video-TARGETNAME* so we can uniquely identify the device
      associated to screen capture for said target.

    :param str mimetype: MIME type of the capture output, eg image/png

    :param list pre_commands: (optional) list of commands (str) to
      execute before the command line, to for example, set parameters
      eg:

      >>> pre_commands = [
      >>>     # set some video parameter
      >>>     "v4l-ctl -i /dev/video-%(id)s -someparam 45",
      >>> ]

    Note all string parameters are `%(keyword)s` expanded from the
    target's tags (as reported by `tcf list -vv TARGETNAME`), such as:

    - output_file_name: name of the file where to dump the capture
      output; file shall be overwritten.
    - id: target's name
    - type: target's type
    - ... (more with `tcf list -vv TARGETNAME`)

    :param str extension: (optional) string to append to the filename,
      like for example, an extension. This is needed because some
      capture programs *insist* on guessing the file type from the
      file name and balk of there is no proper extension; eg:

      >>> extension = ".png"

      avoid adding the extension to the command name you are asking to
      execute, as the system needs to know the full file name.

    **System configuration**

    It is highly recommendable to configure *udev* to generate device
    nodes named after the target's name, so make configuration simpler
    and isolate the system from changes in the device enumeration
    order.

    For example, adding to `/etc/udev/rules.d/90-ttbd.rules`::

      SUBSYSTEM == "video4linux", ACTION == "add", \
          KERNEL=="video*", \
          ENV{ID_SERIAL} == "SERIALNUMBER", \
          SYMLINK += "video-TARGETNAME"

    where *SERIALNUMBER* is the serial number of the device that
    captures the screen for *TARGETNAME*. Note it is recommended to
    call the video interface *video-SOMETHING* so that tools such as
    *ffmpeg* won't be confused.

class generic_stream(impl_c):
    """
    This is a generic stream capturer which can be used to invoke any
    program that will do capture the stream for a while.

    For example, in a server configuration file, define a capturer
    that will record video with ffmpeg from a camera that is pointing
    to the target's monitor or an HDMI capturer:

    >>> capture_vstream_ffmpeg_v4l = ttbl.capture.generic_snapshot(
    >>>    "%(id)s screen",
    >>>    "ffmpeg -i /dev/video-%(id)s-0"
    >>>    " -f avi -qscale:v 10 -y %(output_file_name)s",
    >>>     mimetype = "video/avi",
    >>>     wait_to_kill = 0.25,
    >>>     pre_commands = [
    >>>         "v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video-%(id)s-0 -c focus_auto=0"
    >>>     ]
    >>> )

    Then attach the capture interface to the target with:

    >>> ttbl.config.targets['TARGETNAME'].interface_add(
    >>>     "capture",
    >>>     ttbl.capture.interface(
    >>>         hdmi0_vstream = capture_vstream_ffmpeg_v4l,
    >>>         ...
    >>>     )
    >>> )

    Now, when the client runs to start the capture::

      $ tcf capture-start TARGETNAME hdmi0_vstream

    will execute in the server the pre-commands::

      $ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video-TARGETNAME-0 -c focus_auto=0

    and then start recording with::

      $ ffmpeg -i /dev/video-TARGETNAME-0 -f avi -qscale:v 10 -y SOMEFILE

    so that when we decide it is done, in the client::

      $ tcf capture-get TARGETNAME hdmi0_vstream file.avi

    it will stop recording and download the video file with the
    recording to `file.avi`.

    :param str name: name for error messges from this capturer
    :param str cmdline: commandline to invoke the capturing of the
      stream
    :param str mimetype: MIME type of the capture output, eg video/avi
    :param list pre_commands: (optional) list of commands (str) to
      execute before the command line, to for example, set
      volumes.
    :param int wait_to_kill: (optional) time to wait since we send a
      SIGTERM to the capturing process until we send a SIGKILL, so it
      has time to close the capture file. Defaults to one second.

    Note all string parameters are `%(keyword)s` expanded from the
    target's tags (as reported by `tcf list -vv TARGETNAME`), such as:

    - output_file_name: name of the file where to dump the capture
      output; file shall be overwritten.
    - id: target's name
    - type: target's type
    - ... (more with `tcf list -vv TARGETNAME`)

    For more information, look at :class:`ttbl.capture.generic_snapshot`.
