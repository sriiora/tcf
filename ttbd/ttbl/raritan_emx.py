    Power control interface for the Raritan EMX family of PDUs (eg: PX3-\*)

    Tested with a PX3-5190R with FW v3.3.10.5-43736

    In any place in the TCF server configuration where a power control
    implementation is needed and served by this PDU, thus insert:

    >>> import ttbl.raritan_emx
    >>>
    >>> ...
    >>>    ttbl.raritan_emx.pci('https://USER:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME', OUTLET#)

    :param str url: URL to access the PDU in the form::

        https://[USERNAME:PASSWORD@]HOSTNAME

      Note the login credentials are optional, but must be matching
      whatever is configured in the PDU for HTTP basic
      authentication and permissions to change outlet state.

    :param int outlet: number of the outlet in the PDU to control;
      this is an integer 1-N (N varies depending on the PDU model)

    :param bool https_verify: (optional, default *True*) do or
      do not HTTPS certificate verification.

    The RPC implementation is documented in
    https://help.raritan.com/json-rpc/emx/v3.4.0; while this driver
    uses the Raritan SDK driver, probably this is overkill--we could
    do the calls using JSON-RPC directly using jsonrpclib to avoid
    having to install the SDK, which is not packaged for easy
    redistribution and install.

    .. _raritan_emx_setup:

    **Bill of materials**

    - a Raritan EMX-compatible PDU (such as the PX3)

    - a network cable

    - a connection to a network switch to which the server is also
      connected (*nsN*) -- ideally this shall be an infrastructure
      network, isolated from a general use network and any test
      networks.

    **System setup**

    In the server

    1. Install the Raritan's SDK (it is not available as a PIP
       package) from https://www.raritan.com/support/product/emx
       (EMX JSON-RPC SDK)::

         $ wget http://cdn.raritan.com/download/EMX/version-3.5.0/EMX_JSON_RPC_SDK_3.5.0_45371.zip
         $ unzip -x EMX_JSON_RPC_SDK_3.5.0_45371.zip
         $ install -m 0755 -o root -g root -d /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/raritan
         $ cp -a emx-json-rpc-sdk-030500-45371/emx-python-api/raritan/* /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/raritan

    2. As the Raritan SDK had to be installed manually away from PIP
       or distro package management, ensurePython to looks into
       */usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages* for packages.

       Add your server configuration in a
       */etc/ttbd-production/conf_00_paths.py*::

         sys.path.append("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")

       so it is parsed before any configuration that tries to import
       :mod:`ttbl.raritan_emx`.

    **Connecting the PDU**

    - Connect the PDU to the network

    - Assign the right IP and ensure name resolution works; convention
      is to use a short name *spN* (for Switch Power number *N*)

    - Configure a username/password with privilege to set the outlet
      state

    - Configure the system to power up all outlets after power loss
      (this is needed so the infrastructure can bring itself up
      without intervention, as for example it is a good practice to
      connect the servers to switched outlets so they can be remotely
      controlled).
