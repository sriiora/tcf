    Implement a test target that runs under a QEMU subprocess.

    Supports power control, serial consoles and image flashing.

    A subclass of this must provide a command line to start QEMU, as
    described in :data:`qemu_cmdlines`.

    For the console read interface to work, the configuration must export a
    logfile called BSP-console.read in the state directory. For write
    to work, it must provide a socket BSP-console.write::

      # Serial console tt_qemu.py can grok
      -chardev socket,id=ttyS0,server,nowait,path=%(path)s/%(bsp)s-console.write,logfile=%(path)s/%(bsp)s-console.read
      -serial chardev:ttyS0

    Using power_on_pre, power_on_post and power_off_pre functions, one
    can add functionality without modifying this file.

    :param bsps: list of BSPs to start in parallel (normally only one
      is set); information has to be present in the tags description
      for it to be valid, as well as command lines for starting
      each. If more than one BSP is available, this is the equivalent
      of having a multicore machine that can be asymetric. Thisis
      mostly used for testing.

    **WARNING**

    Note this might be called from different processes who share the
    same configuration; hence we can't rely on any runtime
    storage. Any values that are needed are kept on a filesystem
    database (`self.fsdb`). We start the process with Python's
    subprocess.Popen(), but then it goes on background and if the
    parent dies, the main server process will reap it (as prctl() has
    set with SIG_IGN on SIGCHLD) and any subprocess of the main
    process might kill it when power-off is called on it.
