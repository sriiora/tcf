Control power to targets
------------------------

This interface provides means to power on/off targets and the invidual
components that compose the power rail of a target.

The interface is implemented by :class:`ttbl.power.interface` needs to
be attached to a target with :meth:`ttbl.test_target.interface_add`::

>>> ttbl.config.targets[NAME].interface_add(
>>>     "INTERFACENAME",
>>>     ttbl.power.interface(
>>>         component0,
>>>         component1,
>>>         ...
>>>     )

each component is an instance of a subclass of
:class:`ttbl.power.impl_c`, which implements the actual control over
the power unit, such as:

- PDU socket: :class:`Digital Logger's Web Power Switch
  7<ttbl.pc.dlwps7>`, :class:`YKush <ttbl.pc_ykush.ykush>` power
  switch hub, raritan EMX
- relays: :class:`USB-RLY08b <ttbl.usbrly08b.pc>`
- control over IPMI: :class:`ttbl.ipmi.pci`

Also power components are able to:

- start / stop daemons in the server (*socat*, *rsync*, *qemu*,
  *openocd*...)

- :class:`delay <ttbl.pc.delay>` the power on/off sequence

- wait for some particular conditions to happen: a file
  :class:`dissapearing <ttbl.pc.delay_til_file_gone>` or
  :class:`appearing <ttbl.pc.delay_til_file_appears>`, a USB device is
  :class:`detected <ttbl.pc.delay_til_usb_device>` in the system

    """Implementation interface to drive a  power component

    A power component is an individual entity that provides one of the
    pieces of a power rail needed to power up a target.

    It can be powered on, off and it's state can be acquired.

    A driver is made by subclassing this object, implementing the
    :meth:`on`, :meth:`off` and :meth:`get` methods and then adding
    it to a power interface :class:`ttbl.power.interface` which is
    then attached to a target.

    Drivers implement the specifics to run the switches PDUs, relays,
    etc

    Note these are designed to be as stateless as possible; in most
    cases all the state needed can be derived from the *target* and
    *component* parameters passed to the methods.

    Remember no information can be stored *self* or *target* as the
    next call can come in another daemon implementing the same
    target. For storage, use the target's *fsdb* interface.

    **ALL** the methods have to be blocking, so the operation is
    supposed to be completed and the status has to have been changed
    by the time the call returns. If the operation cannot be trusted
    to be blocking, set the *paranoid* parameter to *True* so the
    power interface will confirm the change has re-happened and
    enforce it again.

    :param bool paranoid: don't trust the operation is really
      blocking, as it should, so double check the state changed happen
      and retry if not.

class socat_pc(daemon_c):
    """
    Generic power component that starts/stops socat as daemon

    This class is meant to be subclassed for an implementation passing
    the actual addresses to use.

    :param str address1: first address for socat; will be templated
      with *%(FIELD)s* to the target's keywords and anything added in
      :data:`kws`.
    :param str address2: second address for socat; templated as
      *address1*
    :param dict env_add: variables to add to the environment when
      running socat
    :param float precheck_wait: seconds to wait once starting before
      checking if the daemon is running; sometimes it dies after we
      check, so it is good to give it a wait.

    This object (or what is derived from it) can be passed to a power
    interface for implementation, eg:

    >>> ttbl.config.targets['TARGETNAME'].interface_add(
    >>>     "power",
    >>>     ttbl.power.interface(
    >>>         ttbl.power.socat_pc(ADDR1, ADDR2)
    >>>     )
    >>> )

    Upon power up, the *socat* daemon will be started, with it's
    current directory set to the target's state directory and a log
    file called after the component (*NAME-socat.log*). When powering
    off, the daemon is stopped.

    Anything coming of the *ipmitool's* *stderr* is sent to a file
    called *NAME-socat.stderr*.

    Specifying addresses is very specific to the usage that it is to
    be done of it, but for example:

    - ``PTY,link=console-%(component)s.write!!CREATE:console-%(component)s.read``

      creates a PTY which will pass whatever is written to
      ``console-COMPONENT.write`` to the second address and whatever
      is read from it to ``console-COMPONENT.read`` (!! serves like a
      bifurcator).

    - ``/dev/ttyS0,creat=0,rawer,b115200,parenb=0,cs8,bs1

      opens a serial port and writes to it whatever is written to
      ``console-COMPONENT.write`` and anything that is read from the
      serial port will be appended to file ``console-COMPONENT.read``.

    - ``EXEC:'/usr/bin/ipmitool -H HOSTNAME -U USERNAME -E -I lanplus sol activate',sighup,sigint,sigquit``

      runs the program *ipmitool*, writes to *stdin* whatever is
      written to *console-COMPONENT.write* and whatever comes out of
      *stdout* is written to *console-COMPONENT.read*.


    For examples, look at :class:`ttbl.console.serial_pc` and
    :class:`ttbl.console.ipmi_sol_pc`.

    ** Tricks for debugging **
    
    Sometimes it just dies and we are left wondering

    - prepend to *EXEC* *strace -fo /tmp/strace.log *, as in::

        EXEC:'strace -fo /tmp/strace.log COMMANDTHATDIES'

      find information in server's ``/tmp/strace.log`` when power
      cycling

    - check the socat options *nl*, *crnl* to strip trailing CRs, for
      example
